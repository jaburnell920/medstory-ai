   - Made the description more concise and in one sentence

2. **Enhanced Simulation Guidelines**:

   - Added requirement to be concise and not provide too many scientific details unless asked

4. **Added Highlight Extraction Action**:
   - New API endpoint action for extracting highlights
   - Focuses only on medical content
   - Returns numbered list with blank lines between highlights
   - Uses lower temperature (0.3) for more focused extraction

   - Updated placeholder text to guide user when awaiting highlight response
   - Added logic to detect "yes" responses to highlight extraction question
   - Integrated with new API endpoint for highlight extraction

4. **Updated Key Points Display**:
   - Changed title from "Key Points from Interview" to "Key Highlights from Interview"
   - Shows highlights immediately when extracted (not dependent on interview end state)
   - Maintains checkbox functionality for selecting highlights

5. **Removed Old Functions**:
   - Removed the old `handleEndInterview` function
   - Removed `onEndInterview` prop from ChatInterface

### Key Features of New Implementation

4. **Better User Experience**: Clear prompts guide the user through the highlight extraction process.

5. **Consistent Persona**: The expert maintains a consistent persona based on their public behavior and materials.
