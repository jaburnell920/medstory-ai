# Task List

1. ✅ Analyze tension-resolution API endpoint and identify root cause of Attack Point formatting bug
Identified cleanAIResponse function as root cause - inconsistently processing OpenAI responses
2. ✅ Fix cleanAIResponse function to preserve Attack Point structure and add missing headers
Enhanced function with robust fallback logic and improved detection patterns
3. ✅ Update user prompt to be more explicit about required Attack Point format
Added explicit requirement for 'Attack Point #1' format in user prompt
4. ✅ Test API endpoints via curl to verify proper formatting
Both 'start' and 'continue' actions return properly formatted responses
5. ✅ Test complete UI flow including 'use current' and 'new one' scenarios
Successfully tested both scenarios - Attack Point formatting is now consistent with proper blue/bold styling
